üîé 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Basic structure

        Check dataset shape, column types, class distribution (spam vs ham).

        Look for duplicates and missing values.

    Univariate analysis

        Word counts distribution per message.

        Message length distribution for spam vs ham.

        Most common words in spam vs ham (word clouds or barplots).

    Bivariate analysis

        Compare average message length between spam and ham.

    Correlation heatmap

        Correlation between engineered numerical features (length, word count, special characters).

üõ† 2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

    Text cleaning: lowercase, remove punctuation/numbers, strip whitespace.

        Remove stopwords and apply stemming/lemmatization.

        Encode labels: spam = 1, ham = 0.

    Feature extraction:

        Bag of Words (CountVectorizer).

        TF-IDF representation.

        Additional features (message length, number of digits, number of uppercase words).

üìà 3. Modeling Practice

    Baseline models

        Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB).

        Logistic Regression.

    Tree-based models

        Random Forest.

        XGBoost / LightGBM.

    Evaluation metrics

        Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

        Confusion Matrix.

        ROC Curve & AUC.

    Validation

        Stratified train-test split.

        Cross-validation to reduce bias from imbalance.

üîç 4. Deeper Analysis Questions

    Which words are the strongest indicators of spam?

    Are spam messages generally longer/shorter than ham messages?

    Does TF-IDF improve performance over simple Bag-of-Words?

    How does class imbalance affect results (spam < ham)?

üí° Stretch Tasks (More Advanced)

    Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText).

    Deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, BERT).

    Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV.

    Feature importance visualization (e.g., SHAP for Logistic Regression / XGBoost).
